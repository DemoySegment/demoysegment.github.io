<!-- for now I will keep everything on only this file, as I have not much stuffs to share -->
Welcome! I am a second year PhD student at Purdue University, in the department of Computer Science, currently working under the advice of [Dr. Christos Mousas](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~cmousas/). Previously, I was a Master's student majoring in Computer Engineering. I started to be admitted to research there and was fortunate to get instructions from [Prof. Qi Sun](https://qisun.me/) as well as [Prof Yao Wang](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/yao-wang). (Great thanks to my mentors!) I received my B.E. in Software Engineering degree from Fudan University.

My research interest revolves around VR/AR, computer graphics, 3D vision and HCI. More specifically, I enjoy exploring how to embed machine learning methods into VR for more immersive experience.
